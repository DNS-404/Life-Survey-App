(THIS APP IS NOT LIVE.) <br>
Life Survey App asks you the most important questions on life. <br>
It's a web app made by me in React with :heart:. <br>
It uses firebase as backend to store the data given by user in a database. <br>

Running on localhost <br>
Step 1: Fork the Life-Survey-App repository and clone it to your machine <br>
Step 2: Cd into the cloned folder <br>
Step 3: Install all the dependencies with: `$ npm install` <br>
Step 4: Run on http://localhost:3000 with: `$ npm run start`<br>
<br>

NOTE - You have to install npm before you can run this. <br>
<br>
Source code can be found in `src/Survey.js` <br>
